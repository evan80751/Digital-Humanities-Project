            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For over a century, the small town of Iliff, Colorado has experienced dramatic economic cycles driven by forces beyond its residents' control. This interactive visualization tracks population changes, agricultural industry data, and major historical events from 1900-2020 to reveal patterns of boom and bust common to small agricultural communities across the American West.</p>

            <p>Building on research conducted for the Wikipedia article on Iliff, this Digital Humanities project applies computational methods to make economic patterns visible. By integrating census data, agricultural statistics, business counts, and historical events into an interactive timeline, we can see how infrastructure decisions, natural disasters, and agricultural industry shifts determined the fate of rural communities in the 20th century.</p>

            <p>This visualization demonstrates how digital tools can reveal connections and patterns that traditional historical narrative cannot effectively convey—showing not just what happened to Iliff, but why small agricultural towns across America followed similar trajectories.</p>

            <h2>Analysis: Three Phases of Economic Cycles</h2>

            <div class="phase-card boom">
                <h3>Phase 1: Early Growth Era (1900-1940s)</h3>
                <p>Railroad connectivity and sugar beet industry expansion drove population growth and business development, attracting diverse immigrant labor forces. The Union Pacific Railroad (1881) provided crucial transportation infrastructure, while the Sterling Sugar Company factory (1905) triggered "unprecedented growth." Mexican, German Russian, and Japanese immigrants provided the labor force that sustained agricultural expansion.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="phase-card transition">
                <h3>Phase 2: Mid-Century Stability and Decline (1950s-1980s)</h3>
                <p>Natural disasters (1949 blizzard, 1965 flood), Great Depression impacts, World War II disruptions, and the Interstate 76 bypass (1958) initiated gradual decline. The highway rerouting was particularly devastating—residents no longer needed to stop in Iliff, instead driving directly to Sterling. Business count peaked at 11 in 1957, then steadily declined.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="phase-card bust">
                <h3>Phase 3: Post-Industrial Collapse (1985-present)</h3>
                <p>The Great Western Sugar Company bankruptcy and Sterling factory closure in 1985 ended the 80-year sugar beet era that had been Iliff's economic foundation. Without the agricultural processing infrastructure, the town lost its primary economic reason for existence. Slight population fluctuations in recent decades suggest ongoing resilience, but the fundamental economic base never recovered.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="conclusion-text">This pattern mirrors countless small agricultural towns across the Great Plains—communities whose fates were determined by external infrastructure decisions, corporate agricultural consolidation, and the decline of rural America in the late 20th century.</p>
