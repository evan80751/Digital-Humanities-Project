Originally designated Interstate 80S when construction began in August 1958, the highway bypassed Iliff and drew traffic away from State Highway 138, accelerating the town's economic decline as residents increasingly drove the 12 miles to Sterling for services.</p>

                        <p>State Highway 138, which runs through Iliff, served as the main transportation corridor before Interstate 76 was constructed in 1958. The interstate bypass diverted through-traffic away from the highway, reducing commercial activity and contributing to the gradual decline of businesses along this historic route.</p>
